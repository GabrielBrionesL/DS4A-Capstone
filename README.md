Data Science for All by Correlation One - Empowerment Cohort 4

Team 26: Cynthia Fonderson, Gabriel Briones, Solomon Berhe, Moradeke Adeniji-Somefun

This folder contains the work my team and I completed in fulfillment of our DS4A Fellowship. For our capstone project, we chose to investigate the interplay between racial disparities in pregnancy-related mortality and socioeconomic factors. Selected factors considered include: race, income, marital status, education, employment, access to health care, fertility, poverty rates, citizenship, and location.
